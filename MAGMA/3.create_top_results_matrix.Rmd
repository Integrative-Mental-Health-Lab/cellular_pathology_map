Pairwise conditional analyses can be costly memory-wise. Hence, we first narrow down the input matrix to our interested top cell types before conducting conditional analyses.

Load libraries.
```{r, message=F}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
```

```{r}
filename_spe_matrix = "gene-level/Siletti_l2_conti_specificity_matrix.txt"
filename_marg_result = "SCZ/Siletti_l2_conti-spe_SCZ_2022.gsa.out"
filename_output = "SCZ/Siletti_l2_specificity_matrix_sig-only_SCZ_2022.txt"
```

```{r, message=F}
df <- read_tsv(filename_spe_matrix)
df_marg <- read_table(filename_marg_result, skip=4) %>%  # skip headers (3-4 lines)
  arrange(P) %>%
  filter(P < 0.05/n())    # get all of the significant clusters after Bonferroni correction. 
sig_list <- df_marg$VARIABLE
```

```{r}
df_sig <- df[c("GENE", sig_list)]
write_tsv(df_sig, filename_output)
```
