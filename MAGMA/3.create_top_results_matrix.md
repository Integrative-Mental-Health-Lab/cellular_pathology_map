Pairwise conditional analyses can be costly memory-wise. Hence, we first narrow down the input matrix to our interested top cell types before conducting conditional analyses.

Load libraries.

```r
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
```


```r
filename_spe_matrix = "gene-level/Siletti_l2_conti_specificity_matrix.txt"
filename_marg_result = "SCZ/Siletti_l2_conti-spe_SCZ_2022.gsa.out"
filename_output = "SCZ/Siletti_l2_specificity_matrix_sig-only_SCZ_2022.txt"
```


```r
df <- read_tsv(filename_spe_matrix)
df_marg <- read_table(filename_marg_result, skip=4) %>% 
  arrange(P) %>%
#  slice_head(n=50)    # get the top 50 clusters 
  filter(P < 0.05/n())    # get all of the significant clusters after Bonferroni correction. 
sig_list <- df_marg$VARIABLE
```


```r
df_sig <- df[c("GENE", sig_list)]
write_tsv(df_sig, filename_output)
```
